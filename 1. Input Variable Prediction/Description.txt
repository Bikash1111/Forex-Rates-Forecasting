The CollectivePrediction.m is the code which is written to predict the input variables' future values to be given as input to 
predict the final variable's future values. 

The file uses the trained NAR networks of different input variables and simulates the prediction output of
those variables which is then fed into the final network that is used to predict the final variable - the
future exchange rate of a particular desired currency.
